1. Backtracking:
    - Is simply brute forcing each and every choice.
    - Always uses recursion to solve problem
    - Follows DFS
    Use when:
    - The problem requires exploring all possible combinations or arrangements.
    - You must try, test, and revert (undo) choices that lead to dead ends (i.e., invalid states).
    - There are constraints involved, and not all paths need to be explored if a 
        certain condition fails early.
    - The solution involves constructing partial candidates and pruning those 
        that donâ€™t satisfy the condition.
